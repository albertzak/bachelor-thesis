\subsection{Problem}

Hand-incrementing version numbers; Hand-written appup files; Many tools to configure; Storing/Fetching/Unpacking previous releases; Non-obvious OS disparity; dependence on system-installed Erlang libraries


\subsection{Goal}

Method: Design, prototype Implementation, Evaluation.
Contribution: A build tool for better DSU support in Erlang/OTP projects that is easy to setup, integrates with the git SCM to use commit hashes as version numbers, handles building and storing OTP Releases and upgrades in an automated way, runs on major CI platforms;
Evaluation of setup effort [?] and run times on major CI platforms.

\section*{Abstract}

The Erlang/OTP Release process requires manual interaction at many steps. Previous work on automating Erlang/OTP Release generation has addressed parts of the process by abstracting the low-level mechanics of the build step, but tasks such as versioning, writing upgrade instructions, and handling artifacts were left to the developer. This thesis proposes  the design of a build tool that trades customizability for hands-off operation as part of a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

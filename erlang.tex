Listing~\ref{lst:loop_example} shows how state is passed between iterations of a server loop.
\lstinline{spawn_link/3} atomically spawns a process and links it to the calling process, so that the calling process is notified when the spawned process crashes.

The spawn function takes the name of a module, the name of the function to run, and a list of arbitrary arguments. This triplet pointing to a function of a module and giving its arguments is commonly called \acrfull{mfa}.

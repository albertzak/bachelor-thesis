\chapter*{Abstract}

The core challenge is that the Erlang/OTP release process requires manual interaction at many steps.
Previous work on automating Erlang/OTP Release generation has addressed parts of the process by abstracting the low-level mechanics of the build step, but tasks such as versioning, release management, and deployment were left to the developer.
This thesis proposes an integrated pipeline for building and deploying Erlang/OTP projects.

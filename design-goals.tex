\section{Design Goals}

The primary design goal is to require as little interaction as possible from the developer to build a release.

% TODO: Why?

First, we propose replacing traditional version numbers with commit hashes to (1) relieve the developer of handling versioning, and (2) to guarantee uniqueness and identifiability of each revision.

Second, we propose that artifacts be built inside a standardized environment using declarative container technology to guarantee repeatability of builds.

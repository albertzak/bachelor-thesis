### What is this about?

This is the first time I attempt to write a somewhat larger work.

Whenever I discover something interesting, I save scraps, copy/pastes, quotes, etc. in the Apple Notes app. These are private for now. As soon as I feel that a thought emerges, I try to practice [free writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing) inside this public [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2W1z9SY6Gm4ViYGpnO77m-5yJ29KECTWJvy6sMa7h4/edit?usp=sharing).

I haven't yet started writing a draft; expect to see LaTeX sources and links to the built PDFs here soon.

The project's code will live inside a separate repository.

### Why?

- To be held accountable.
- To improve my writing.

## Downtime-free Continuous Deployment of Erlang/OTP Applications

*(working title)*

Bachelor's Thesis<br>

2017

### What is this about?

This is the first time I attempt to write a somewhat larger work.

Whenever I discover something interesting, I save scraps, copy/pastes, quotes, etc. in the Apple Notes app. These are private for now. As soon as I feel that a thought emerges, I try to practice [free writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing) inside this public [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2W1z9SY6Gm4ViYGpnO77m-5yJ29KECTWJvy6sMa7h4/edit?usp=sharing).

The LaTeX sources are compiled to PDF on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/albertzak/bachelor-thesis), and are automatically uploaded to the [releases page](https://github.com/albertzak/bachelor-thesis/releases) of this repository.


The project's code will live under the [beamup-io organization](https://github.com/beamup-io)

### Why?

- To be held accountable.
- To improve my writing.
